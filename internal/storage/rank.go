// RankMove reports the pair a relative rank operation actually applied to
// after frame resolution: MovedID was re-ranked relative to AnchorID. When
// the named issue and target are frame-mates these are the inputs unchanged;
// cross-frame, one or both are the containing ancestors that were comparable.
// Callers surface the substitution to the user — moving an issue other than
// the one named must never be silent. [LAW:no-silent-failure]

// RankSetResolution pairs each ID named in a rank-set request with the

// RankedID are equal for frame-mates; when they differ the caller must surface
// the substitution — ranking a different issue than named is never silent.
